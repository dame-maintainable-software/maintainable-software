# Hands-on time

* As seen  before the simple-calculator is missing some functionalities
* Create an *issue* in the [maintainable-software repository](https://github.com/dame-maintainable-software/maintainable-software)
    * Try to use some of the features github provides you with
    * Include references to the affected code
    * Mention and request feedback from a colleague
    * Assign the issue to your neighbour
